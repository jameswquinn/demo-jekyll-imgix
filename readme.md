If you do want to run this demo locally to see how Jekyll and imgix work, I have included a `rake` command for running Jekyll with the jekyll-imgix plugin.

1. Install Ruby
2. run `$ bundle install`
3. run `$ rake serve`

Edit the `_examples` files or play around with the `srcset` values in the `_config.yml` file.
